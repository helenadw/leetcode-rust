# Solving Two Sum

## The challenge

We are given two arguments, an array of intergers and a target value. We need to write a function that can reach the target value by summing two values in the array and then returning their indices. We can assume that there will always be a pair of values that sum to the target, and that there will only be one possible correct answer.

For example, 

- Array of numbers, `[1, 4, 6, 7]`
- Target value `11`

Thinking through how we would solve this without code, we could:
- check each number in the array, from start to end
    - subtract that value from the target and keep track of it's index
    - check if the result of this calculation is present in the array
        - if it isn't, repeat the process
        - if it is, this is our answer
        - return the index of this value + the index of the comparison value


Thinking through this with values would go like this:

- comparison value `1` in position `0`
    - subtract comparison value `1` from target `11`, result value `10`
    - check the array for the result value `10`
        - it doesn't exist, move on to next value
- comparison value `4` in position `1`
    - subtract comparison value `4` from target `11`, result value `7`
    - check the array for the result value `7`
        - find value `7` in position `3`
        - return comparison value's position `1` and result value's position `3`


### Now we can express this in code:
```
impl Solution {
    pub fn two_sum(nums: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut map = std::collections::HashMap::new();
        for (i, &value) in nums.iter().enumerate() {
            let pair = target - value;
            if let Some(&j) = map.get(&pair) {
                return vec![j as i32, i as i32];
            } else {
                map.insert(value, i);
            }
        }
        vec![]
    }
}
```
